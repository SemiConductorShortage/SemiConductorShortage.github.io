            I'm so sorry you guys have to read this from my site. I should've been straightforward and told you face-to-face. <br />
            But I'm too much of a coward to do that. Truth is, I've been manipulating you all since the very beginning, and I've been <br />
            maintaining this fake online persona where im just a person who likes joking around and keeps fooling around with webpages <br />
            You can't even begin to imagine the pain when I was writing this, it's just too much for me and I'm sorry if its too much for you, <br />
            but the point is, I'm never honest, and that I've been using you all to get an advantage. All of it just for a single server: YouTube Unsolved<br />
            I've gotten Mello banned because I framed him for some stuff he didn't do. The alts he "interrogated" was all mine. I gave him 2 options:<br />
            - Attack the alt<br />
            - Get kicked off the mod team for using a message logger (with faked evidence)<br />
            I also faked conversations with Fives to make you all think he selfbotted <br />
            I'm not even Armenian, I just faked it so that I can get close with the mod team <br />
            and have a positive word put in about me. I apologize<br />
            are those enough lines for the screen or do i need more goddamn im just writing filler text to make this seem legit behind the blur, I've never done any of the above + im armenian
